def - what follows is going to be a function
every function is going to have a return
the main is our entry point - (bottom)
always set up skelton code to know the first part works *Print(hello)*
dont keep the prints, just an outline to make sure works
in parenthesis (1,2,3) passes it 1,2,3 for f1, f2, f3
delete the prints and replace with returns
midterm f1, f2, and f3 will be called something else to do something else

at the bottom, the if function is telling the compliler when you look at the
different functions, where you want to begin
so it will begin at main. will begin wherever you tell it to
